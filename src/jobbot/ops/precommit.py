"""Decide whether a commit has to run the unit suite. Local only, no network.

The pre-commit hook used to hold this list as a shell regex, which drifts from
what the tests check. Policy counts as code here: a remote agent working from a
clone has `AGENTS.md` and nothing else, so a change there can break behaviour as
surely as a change in a module.
