"""Inside recon: learn ATS and form questions by reading a page the human is on.

This is the return path of the oneshot: the outside scan finds candidate URLs, but
the **component truth** (ATS kind, registration fields, where a CV uploads) is learned
by entering. The human completes irreversible steps (password, terms, CAPTCHA); JobBot
observes the page they reached and stores technical evidence only.

No invented passwords, no terms, no CAPTCHA bypass, no final account creation.
=======
"""Learn portal truth from a page you are already on (issue #45).

Oneshot classifies career URLs from the outside and often leaves ``ats=unknown``.
Component truth — ATS markers and form questions — is observed **after** the human
has entered (login / account HITL). This module never opens a browser and never
creates an account; it only reads HTML and, with ``apply=True``, writes technical
observations plus form questions (no typed answers).
